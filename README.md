# Habit Tracker

This project is a full-stack application designed to help users track their weekly habits. It utilizes a Django REST framework backend and a React frontend with Vite for an efficient development experience.

## Description

Habits Tracker allows users to create, update, and monitor their weekly habits. It features a modern, responsive UI and a secure, scalable backend. The project is structured into a `frontend` directory for the React application and a `backend` directory for the Django REST API.

## Deployment

The website is deployed using Choreo [here](https://e31f8c15-f7e8-4660-989a-d5008f9d52c1.e1-eu-north-azure.choreoapps.dev). It utilizes a PostgreSQL database to store user data. Currently, the database is not active, which limits functionality to the guest section of the website. Guests can use the same tools as registered users but their data will be stored for session only. Full functionality can be temporarily enabled upon request.
